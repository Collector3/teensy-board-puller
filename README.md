# Teensy board puller

Slip each end underneath a Teensy PCB (or your PCB of choice that fits) and 
rock back and forth with a pulling motion to remove.

For more control, the fingers can snap together to grip the PCB. The best 
way (i've found) of reliably getting this to happen is using a thumb on 
the word 'PCB' and whichever finger comes naturally on the other side.
